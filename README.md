# Preamble :

# Content :
    - Presenation and resume of the person behind (me)
    - Projects 
    - Articles
    - Tutorials 
    - more over...

# Goal : 
The main purpose behind this project is to keep a trace of my achievements and share my humble knowlegde so I can help new comers.
in addition to that, I will work throught this projetr and the coming ones on improving my skills and learn new stuff 

I hope this will be interesting...
